# This action considers that given an image name, it either have:
# 1. a tag with the current triggering event's sha1 --> we need to allign the tag latest with this tag sha1 (creating it if not existing)
# 2. a tag 'latest' exists but no tag named after trigerring event sha1 --> We need to allign the sha1 tag with the existing 'latest' tag
# 
# We should fail if none of these situtations is true
#
# This strategy allows us to consider multi-services deploymnet with a single sha1 commit.
# Note: 
# - Tag latest is not to be referenced. Only to track the 
# - This strategy works if applied on a single branch. Generally the history source of truth for source code: default branch.
#   beware to call this action from a workflow considering a single branch only. Otherwise, latest will be relative and concurently accessed. 
# - To reset the logic, just remove tags latest from your sevice repositories
