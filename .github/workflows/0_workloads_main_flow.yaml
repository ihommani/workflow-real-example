    # TODO: call this same workflow (or an adapted version) that deliver (and not deploy) images on {staging; production} environments
    # To call only if we need to decorelate artifactory repo between environements --> because image content would depends on the environment and we want to avoid at all cost to put the environment name in the tag.  
    # tag should be similar between the different repositories
    # --> NOPE: this is taken into account by the release creation workflow. Artifactory other than integration would contains only release tags

    # TODO: final job : push the badge status. This task should always run even in case of previous task failure
